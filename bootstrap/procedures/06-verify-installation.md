# Procedure: Verify Installation

Verify the bootstrap completed successfully and everything works.

## Purpose

After all bootstrap steps complete, verify that:
- All files were created correctly
- Serena MCP is accessible (if installed)
- The generated CLAUDE.md is valid
- The manifest is complete

## Steps

### 1. Check Generated Files [AUTO]

Verify these files exist:

| File | Required | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Yes | Check exists and is non-empty |
| `claude-docs/README.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `claude-docs/tdd-enforcement.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `claude-docs/code-quality.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `claude-docs/research-workflow.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `docs/adrs/README.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `docs/adrs/000-template.md` | Yes | Check exists |
| `.claude-bootstrap/analysis.json` | Yes | Check exists and is valid JSON |
| `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json` | Yes | Check exists and is valid JSON |

If Serena was installed:
| File | Required | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `.serena/project.yml` | If Serena | Check exists |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | If Serena/MCP | Check contains serena config |

If MCP servers were installed:
| File | Required | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | If MCP | Check contains context7 and sequential-thinking configs |

### 2. Verify CLAUDE.md Content [AUTO]

Check that CLAUDE.md contains:
- [ ] Project name (not placeholder)
- [ ] Primary language (not placeholder)
- [ ] Documentation index with valid links
- [ ] Core principles section
- [ ] No unresolved `{{placeholders}}`

Log any issues found but don't stop for them.

### 3. Verify Serena (if installed) [AUTO]

If Serena was installed, test it works:

1. Try using Serena's `get_symbols_overview` tool on a source file
2. If it responds with symbols, Serena is working
3. If it fails, note the error but continue

### 4. Update Manifest [AUTO]

Update `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "bootstrap_version": "1.0.0",
  "started_at": "...",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
  "steps_completed": ["analyze", "serena", "mcp-servers", "agents", "claude-md", "docs", "adrs", "verify"],
  "steps_skipped": [],
  "verification": {
    "files_created": true,
    "claude_md_valid": true,
    "serena_working": true,
    "verified_at": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 5. Present Summary [AUTO]

Log the final summary:

> "Bootstrap complete! Here's what was set up:
>
> **Files Created:**
> - `CLAUDE.md` - Your project's AI instructions
> - `claude-docs/` - Supporting guides (TDD, code quality, research)
> - `docs/adrs/` - Architecture decision records structure
>
> **Tools Configured:**
> - Serena MCP: [Installed/Skipped]
> - Context7 MCP: [Installed/Skipped] - Up-to-date library documentation
> - Sequential Thinking MCP: [Installed/Skipped] - Structured reasoning
> - Specialized Agents: [Informed/Skipped]
>
> **Verification:**
> - All files created successfully: [Yes/No]
> - CLAUDE.md is valid: [Yes/No]
> - Serena is working: [Yes/No/Not installed]
> - MCP servers configured: [Yes/No]
>
> **Next Steps:**
> 1. Review and customize `CLAUDE.md` for your project
> 2. Add project-specific details to the USER_SECTION blocks
> 3. Create ADRs for existing architectural decisions
> 4. Add Serena memories as you learn about the codebase
> 5. Try Context7: ask about a library with "use context7" in your prompt
>
> You may need to restart Claude Code for all changes to take effect."

### 6. Handle Issues [AUTO]

If verification finds issues:
1. Log all issues found
2. Categorize as critical (blocks usage) or non-critical (cosmetic)
3. For non-critical issues: note them in summary and continue
4. For critical issues: attempt one automatic fix, then log and continue

Do NOT stop bootstrap for verification issues - the user can manually fix problems later.

## Troubleshooting Reference

### CLAUDE.md has unresolved placeholders
- Check `.claude-bootstrap/analysis.json` exists and has valid data
- User can manually edit the placeholders

### Serena not responding
- Restart Claude Code
- Check `.claude/settings.local.json` syntax
- Verify `serena-mcp` is installed globally: `npm list -g serena-mcp`

### Missing files
- Check which procedure failed in manifest
- User can re-run specific procedures manually

### Manifest is corrupted
- Delete `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json`
- Re-run bootstrap if needed

## Output

- Updates manifest with completion status
- Logs success/failure summary
- Provides next steps guidance

## Error Handling

### Cannot Update Manifest

If manifest write fails:
1. Log the verification results to console
2. Note that manifest couldn't be updated
3. Continue - bootstrap is functionally complete

### Verification Finds Issues

For all issues found:
1. Log the issue clearly
2. Attempt automatic fix if simple (e.g., missing file that can be regenerated)
3. Record issue in manifest if possible
4. Continue with summary

## Self-Verification Checklist

Before marking bootstrap as complete, verify:

**File Existence:**
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` exists and is non-empty
- [ ] `claude-docs/` directory exists
- [ ] `claude-docs/README.md` exists
- [ ] `docs/adrs/` exists
- [ ] `.claude-bootstrap/analysis.json` exists
- [ ] `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json` exists

**Final State:**
- [ ] Manifest has completion timestamp
- [ ] Summary was logged

Mark bootstrap as complete and provide summary regardless of minor issues.
