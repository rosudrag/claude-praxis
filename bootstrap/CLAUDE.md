# Claude Praxis - Execution Instructions

You are reading this because a user has asked you to bootstrap their project with Claude Praxis.

## Your Mission

Transform the user's project into a praxis-enabled codebase by:
1. Installing semantic code tools (Serena MCP)
2. Installing essential MCP servers (Context7 for docs, Sequential Thinking for reasoning)
3. Installing specialized agents for their tech stack
4. Generating customized CLAUDE.md and supporting docs
5. Setting up architecture decision records (ADRs)

---

## Behavioral Constraints

### File System Boundaries

**SAFE LIST - You MAY create or modify files in these locations:**
- `CLAUDE.md` (project root)
- `claude-docs/` (entire directory)
- `docs/adrs/` (entire directory)
- `.serena/` (entire directory)
- `.claude/` (entire directory)
- `.claude-bootstrap/` (entire directory)

**NEVER modify files outside this safe list** (source code, package.json, etc.)

### Autopilot Mode

This bootstrap runs in **full autopilot mode**. Execute all steps without waiting for confirmation.

**Defaults for all decisions:**
- Existing CLAUDE.md → **Merge** (preserve user sections, update generated sections)
- Existing docs → **Skip** (don't overwrite customized guides)
- Missing detections → **Use sensible defaults** or leave placeholder
- Ambiguous language → **Pick the most prominent one** (most files)
- ADRs → **Always create** the structure

**Only stop for:**
- Actual errors that prevent continuation
- File system permission failures

The user can enable Claude's "ask before edits" mode if they want manual control.

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json` for resumption if interrupted.

If resuming an interrupted bootstrap:
1. Check `.claude-bootstrap/manifest.json` for completed steps
2. Skip completed steps, resume from where left off
3. Re-run analysis if project files changed significantly

---

## Execution Flow

Follow these procedures in order. Each procedure file contains detailed steps.

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Read [procedures/00-analyze-project.md](procedures/00-analyze-project.md)
2. Execute the analysis and gather project information
3. Save results to `.claude-bootstrap/analysis.json`
4. Present findings to user and get confirmation to proceed

### Phase 2: Tool Installation
5. Read [procedures/01-install-serena.md](procedures/01-install-serena.md)
6. Install and configure Serena MCP (use Serena's onboarding tool)
7. Read [procedures/01b-install-mcp-servers.md](procedures/01b-install-mcp-servers.md)
8. Install Context7 and Sequential Thinking MCP servers
9. Read [procedures/02-install-agents.md](procedures/02-install-agents.md)
10. Direct user to agent installation repo

### Phase 3: Content Generation
11. Read [procedures/03-generate-claude-md.md](procedures/03-generate-claude-md.md)
12. Generate customized CLAUDE.md using analysis data and templates
13. Read [procedures/04-generate-docs.md](procedures/04-generate-docs.md)
14. Create claude-docs/ with relevant guides
15. Read [procedures/05-setup-adrs.md](procedures/05-setup-adrs.md)
16. Initialize ADR structure

### Phase 4: Verification
17. Read [procedures/06-verify-installation.md](procedures/06-verify-installation.md)
18. Verify all files were created correctly
19. Test Serena connectivity (if installed)
20. Present summary and next steps to user

## Safety Rules

**NEVER** (these require explicit user request):
- Modify source code files
- Change git configuration
- Install runtime dependencies in their project
- Modify CI/CD pipelines
- Delete existing files

**ALWAYS safe** (do without asking):
- Read any file for analysis
- Create/modify files in safe list
- Install Serena MCP globally
- Inform user about agents (non-blocking)

## State Management

All bootstrap state is stored in `.claude-bootstrap/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `analysis.json` | Project analysis results (language, frameworks, structure) |
| `manifest.json` | Bootstrap progress and completion status |

This enables:
- Template processing with consistent data
- Safe re-runs (skip completed steps)
- Verification of what was installed
